# Guide to becoming a verifier

Becoming a verifier is an integral aspect of digital trust ecosystems, enabling services to leverage digital credentials issued by trusted entities and held by individuals or organizations. By implementing verification capabilities, services can enhance security, streamline processes and improve user experiences while maintaining privacy and control for credential holders. The following steps provide a guide to becoming a verifier, but remember that this is not a one-size-fits-all approach. You may need to adapt these steps to your specific needs and the process is often iterative rather than strictly linear.

## 1. Identify your verification use case

This involves analyzing your current processes, understanding your specific needs and identifying where digital credential verification can add the most value.

**Things to consider:**
-   Review existing processes that could benefit from digital credential verification
-   Identify pain points in current identity or attribute verification methods
-   Take a step back and consider your ecosystem, understanding your needs and how digital credentials fit within it
-   Evaluate which existing credentials would be most valuable to verify within your use case
-   Consider whether your use case requires existing credentials or if you need to work with a potential issuer to create new ones

## 2. Select your experience pattern

Experience patterns define how users will interact with your verification system. Choosing the right pattern based on user needs and value add ensures a smooth integration of verification into your service.

**Things to consider:**
-   Understand common experience patterns and their use cases
-   Align the chosen pattern with your service's requirements and user needs
-   Review the governance framework associated with your chosen solution

## 3. Define your credential scheme and presentation requests

Schemas and presentation requests determine what data you'll verify and how. This step is crucial for ensuring you collect only necessary information while preserving user privacy.

**Things to consider:**
-   Determine whether your use case will rely on existing credentials or require new ones    
-   Align with existing credential schemas where possible    
-   Implement privacy-preserving techniques such as selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, and predicates    
-   Ensure your requests align with issuer governance frameworks    
-   Request only information that is strictly necessary for your service

## 4. Review relevant governance frameworks

Governance frameworks provide the rules and standards for digital credential ecosystems. Aligning with these frameworks ensures your verification process is compliant and interoperable.

**Things to consider:**
-   Identify applicable regulations (e.g., privacy laws, industry standards)    
-   Review existing governance frameworks for digital credentials in your domain    
-   Consider how governance requirements might impact your verification process

## 5. Map Service and User Journeys

A clear ene-to-end service and user journey is essential for a seamless verification experience. This step involves visualizing how verification will fit into your users' interactions with your service.

**Things to consider:**
-   Analyze your current user journey and identify where verification fits    
-   Consider the impact on user experience when transitioning to digital credentials    
-   Evaluate how verified data can streamline or eliminate existing steps in your digital service    
-   Plan for user education and support during the transition    
-   Consider multi-channel approaches (mobile, desktop, phone, in-person, paper, etc.)   
-   Be aware that BC Wallet and credentials for individuals are currently only available via smartphone    
-   Note that services relying solely on digital credentials may impose accessibility constraints
