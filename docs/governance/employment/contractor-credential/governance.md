# Contractor Credential

# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1 Introduction
This document outlines the Governance Framework (GF) for the Contractor Credential, a digital credential designed to represent an active contract between a contractor and a specific organization. The Contractor Credential intends to provide a standardized, secure, and verifiable means of identifying and recognizing contractors who have a current contractual relationship with the organization. The structure of the credential is designed to encapsulate essential information, such as the contractor's identity, the contracting organization, and the contract's status, ensuring clarity and consistency in its representation across systems and processes.

The Contractor Credential is designed to be issued by the Information Technology (IT) or Human Resources (HR) department during the contractor’s onboarding process. This credential serves as a versatile and standardized proof of the contractor’s status, allowing issuers and verifiers the flexibility to utilize it according to their specific needs.

***Acknowledgements***:
The development of this documentation follows the governance framework created by the [Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/) [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf) created by the [Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group).

***No Warranty***:
The Contractor Credential is provided “as is”, and the Province of British Columbia (the "Province") disclaims all representations, warranties, conditions, obligations, and liabilities of any kind, whether express or implied, in relation to the Contractor Credential, including without limitation implied warranties with respect to merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Without limiting the general nature of the previous sentence, the Province does not represent or warrant that:
 - (a) the Contractor Credential will be available;
 - (b) your use of the Contractor Credential will be timely, uninterrupted or error-free;
 - (c) any errors in the Contractor Credential will be corrected; or
 - (d) the Contractor Credential will meet your expectations and requirements.

***Limitation of Liability***:
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, under no circumstances will the Province be liable to you, to any other individual or to any entity for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other loss, claim, injury or damage, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable (including without limitation claims for damages for loss of profits or business opportunities, use or misuse of, or inability to use, the Contractor Credential, interruptions, deletion or corruption of files, loss of programs or information, errors, defects or delays) arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the Contractor Credential and whether based on contract, tort, strict liability or any other legal theory. The previous sentence will apply even if the Province has been specifically advised of the possibility of any such loss, claim, injury or damage.

## 1.2. Terminology and Notation

Please reference [Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary).

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

- Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT, or REQUIRED keyword.
- Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.
- Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

## 1.6 Purpose 

The purpose of this GF is to define what the Contractor credential is and who is responsible for the authority and administration of its use.

## 1.7 Scope

A Contractor credential issued according to this GF, provides evidence of an active contract between a contractor and a specific organization.

## 1.8 Objectives 

To allow the credential holder evidence they have an active contract in a verifiable credential format that is both secure and tamperproof. 

## 1.9 Principles
