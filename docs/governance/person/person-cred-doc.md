## Credential Overview

The Person credential is a verifiable credential (VC) issued to individuals to enable them to prove their identity and to digitally provide key personal information – name, data of birth, photo, address – to other parties (“verifiers”). The Person credential is intended to be used as a source of trusted identity information in a wide range of contexts, either alone or in conjunction with other credentials. The Person credential currently is only issued to the BC Wallet, a mobile application published by the Digital Identity & Trust Program (DITP) within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) of the BC
Ministry of Citizens’ Services.

## Credential Details

### Issuer

The Person credential is issued by Service BC, the division within the BC Ministry of Citizens’ Services that houses the BC Provincial Identity Information Management (IDIM) Program. IDIM is the digital identity issuer for the BC Services Card Program.

### Issuer Data Source

The Person credential data comes from the digital identity record of the BC Services Card Program, which collects and verifies the personal information of people enrolled in the provincial Medical Services Plan (MSP). A consequence of this is that only people enrolled in MSP can be issued a Person credential. The following people may not enroll in MSP: new arrivals to the province, people who live more than half the year outside the province, military members, and some federal employees. <br></br>
The BC Services Card Program collects name and date of birth from the subject’s Canadian foundational identity documents as well as, if the individual has changed their name, name linking documents (e.g., marriage certificate). Adults are required to present a government-issued photo ID (e.g., driver’s license, passport) during the identity-proofing process and to have their photo taken as part of the identity- proofing event. Address information is provided by the subject but is not verified; ICBC mails each BC Services Card to the address provided by the individual unless the individual arranges to pick it up in person.

#### Data Updates

When a Person credential is issued, its data reflects that of the individual's BC Services Card digital identity record. Changes to this digital identity record will trigger a revocation (and often re-issuance) of the Person credential to ensure the credential reflects the updated identity record; these cases are described in further detail in the section on Revocation, below. <br></br>

The BC Services Card digital identity record may be updated by the individual in two ways:

- An individual wishing to change their name, correct their data of birth, or update their photo must do so in-person and must present documents supporting their identity and the requested change
- Change of address may be done online, with authentication based on shared secrets about the individual

The digital identity record may also be updated by the BC Services Card program, such as when a card expires or when the individual has been reported deceased by the BC Vital Statistics Agency.

### Assurance

The Person credential is based on the BC Services Card digital identity, which is considered a high assurance digital identity credential by both the Government of British Columbia and the Government of Canada.

#### BC Services Card

By design, the BC Services Card digital identity meets the BC Office of the CIO [Identity Assurance Standard](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/identity_assurance_standard.pdf) requirements for a High (3) Identity Assurance Level. It meets this through the combination of its identity proofing process, the security of the issued credential, and the security of its two-factor authentication. <br></br>
The BC Services Card digital identity has been assessed twice, in 2019 and 2021, by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) against the Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PSP- PCTF). In both cases, it was assessed as being a Trusted Digital Identity Level 3 (high), as defined in Appendix A of the TBS [Directive on Identity Management](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16577).

#### Person Credential

The Person credential is based on the BC Services Card digital identity and is securely issued using BC Services Card two-factor authentication into the BC Wallet app. Of note:

- The Person credential is issued to individuals who have been identified at a High (3) Identification Level as defined by the BC Office of the CIO [Identity Assurance Standard](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/identity_assurance_standard.pdf). It is based on the identity record of the BC Services Card and requires the individual to prove who they are using a BC Services Card authenticator, ensuring a Person credential is issued to the correct individual’s wallet
- The Person credential will only be issued to the BC Wallet, which requires authentication to use, protecting use of the Person credential by anyone other than the legitimate holder

### Revocation

A Person credential will be revoked in the following cases:

1. When an individual is issued a new Person credential (with the same or updated identity information), any previous Person credentials issued to that individual will be revoked as part of the issuance process. An individual may only have one active Person credential at a time.
1. When an individual revokes their own credential, which they may do after logging into their [BC Services Card Account](https://id.gov.bc.ca/account/).
1. When authorized IDIM staff revoke the credential, either in response to a support call from the individual (e.g., after losing a mobile device) or for other reasons (e.g., security concerns).
1. The individual’s physical card is suspended or deactivated (e.g., due to fraud) and/or the identity record is retired in the BC Services Card system e.g., due to death
1. The individual’s identity record changes from having been updated with a BC Services Card to
   one set up with other Canadian identity documents

A Person credential will be revoked and re-issued in the following cases:

1. The individual’s identity information (e.g., name, birthdate, address, photo) changes
1. The individual’s card type changes between one that has a photo to one that doesn’t, or from a card type that does not have a photo to one that does

A credential is re-issued by sending an offer, which the individual may choose to accept, to the individual’s wallet. This offer can only be made if the individual’s BC Wallet still has the same Contact<sup>2</sup> through which they were originally issued the credential.

<sup>2</sup>A “Contact” in the BC Wallet is, technically, a [Hyperledger Aries Connection](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md).

## Credential Definition

### Credential Schema

Person credential is based on the Person Schema<sup>3</sup> published by the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec through the CANdy Network. See Credential Overview, above, for details. <br></br>
This section describes how the Person credential implements the Person Credential Type. Unless noted otherwise below, the subject and attributes of the Person credential have been implemented as defined and specified in the Person Schema.

<sup>3</sup> The Schema is a “template that defines a set of attributes” which is referenced by one or more Credential Definitions of one or more credential issuers; the credential definition is an issuer’s implementation of a schema (https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/#terminology). The Person schema is intended to be referenced in the credential definitions by multiple issuers in Canada (e.g., BC, Ontario).

### Subject of the Credential

The subject of a Person credential is the individual to whom it was issued, i.e., its holder. See the Credential Assurance section, above, for why a verifier can be confident that the holder of a Person credential is the subject of the credential.

### Attributes

This section indicates which Person Schema attributes are used by BC, whether there are any BC-specific implementation notes, and some exceptions in the attribute data.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Notes</th>
    <td>
        <ul><li>Attribute data will always be upper case (e.g., "SMITH" not "Smith")</li><li>Allowable Characters: The only characters allowed are the letters A through Z, digits 0 through 9, and the following "special characters": hyphen, apostrophe, period, and space</li><li>Characters are encoded using UTF-8</li></ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Name Attributes

The name attributes of a Person credential will – with some exceptions – reflect the name on the subject’s Canadian foundational identity documents.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Notes</th>
    <td>
        <ul>
            <li>If an individual's name has a special character (e.g., Á, Ê, Ç) or a number in their name on their foundational identity document, it will not be reflected in the name attributes of the Person credential</li>
            <li>The name in the Person credential will normally reflect the name on foundational identity documents or name linking documents (e.g. marriage certificates), but those documents may not reflect the individual’s name. For example</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Some names have special characters that the BC Vital Statistics can print on a birth certificate but does not pass on to the BC Services Card Program computer system</li>
                <li>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will truncate an individual’s name (the combined given names and family name) at 45 characters on IIRC foundational identity documents (e.g., permanent resident card and the student, work, visitor, and temporary-resident permits)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>An individual may use the last name of their spouse without getting a legal name change. In these cases, their Person credential <i>should</i> reflect – via their BC Services Card record – their foundational identity documents, as individuals are required by law to update their BC Services Card when they change their name by marriage or otherwise. Individuals who do this may continue to use their original name in other contexts, and so their Person credential may not be consistent with their other identity documents or credentials bearing their name</li>
        </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>

        <li>First and middle names over 15 characters are truncated</li>
        <li>If the individual has a mononym, this attribute will _normally_ have no value and the mononym will appear in the family_name attribute</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Notes</th>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Names can start with any of the Allowable Characters</li>
        <li>First Names and Middle Names with spaces or punctuation (e.g., “JO ANNE”, “JIAN U”, “D’ARCY”) will have the spaces and punctuation removed (e.g., “JOANNE”, “JIANU”, “DARCY”)</li>
        <li>To work around the removal of spaces, described above, a first name with a space (e.g. “JO ANNE”) may be entered as a first name and a middle name (e.g., “JO ANNE” is entered as “JO” and “ANNE”). This will appear as “JO ANNE” in the given_names attribute, which is indistinguishable from an individual whose first name is “JO” and whose middle name is “ANNE”. Similarly, a middle name with a space (e.g., “MARY LOU”) may be entered as two middle names (e.g., “MARY” and “LOU”). As such, spaces in the given_names attribute are not a reliable delimiter between names</li>
        <li>Some legacy records have only an initial for a middle name (e.g., "J" for "James")</li>
        <li>A mononym may be duplicated in this attribute as well as family_name</li>
        <li>If the individual has a mononym containing a space, the first part of the mononym may be recorded in the given_names attribute and the second part in the family_name attribute</li>
