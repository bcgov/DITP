# Primary Document

## Introduction

This governance framework document has been developed in accordance with the [Trust Over IP’s Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf).

## Purpose

The Purpose of the Provisional Governance Framework, referred to as 'GF' in this document, is to establish technology, interoperability, security, privacy, usability, accessibility, and data protection standards that establish trust in the governance, operation and use of the BC Enterprise Digital Trust Agency (referred to as "Agency" in this document).


## Objectives

The objectives of the Provisional Governance Framework for the Agency are as follows:
* Equip the Governing Authority with a Minimum Viable Governance Framework that supports a service for establishing trusted and enduring digital relationships between services and their users, and will iteratively mature as the service gains more adoption and that allows for agile responses to maturing standards and evolving business requirements.
* Establish technical and organizational measures that ensure trust and operational integrity between British Columbia tenant users and the operators of the Agency.
* Build trust between the service and stakeholders, by making transparent the governance that enables the secure and private operation of the Agency.
* Formalize the relationships and responsibilities between the Governing Authority and the Operations Team in the design, build, governance, and operation of the Agency and Provisional Governance Framework.
* Support initial prioritized implementations of the Agency and assess the viability and relevancy of the framework with real-world use-cases.

## Guiding Principles
The Agency Entity (as per [member hierarchy](#member-hierarchy)) will be led by [British Columbia's Digital Principles](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/resources/digital-principles), the [ToIP Design Principles](https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf), and [ToIP Principles of SSI](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ToIP-Principles-of-SSI.pdf). These principles guide the day-to-day work of BC Public Servants and contractors who are designing, developing, and delivering digital services.

By design, the Agency service is intended for use by government and public-sector entities and is not intended for use by private individuals. 

## Scope

The GF covers the following components:

### Governed Roles

The governed roles in the Agency ecosystem are as follows:
* [Governing Authority](#member-management-policies-governing-authority)
