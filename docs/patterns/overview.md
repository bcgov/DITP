# Digital Trust Patterns

Digital Trust interactions generally follow one (or more) of the following patterns:

- [Access](access.md): when a system requires users to authenticate before they can access protected information or functionality.
- [Verifier](verifier.md): when a system needs to verify that users (or other systems) can provide a valid response to a proof-request. Proof requests could either require information to be shared, or only require proof of specific assertions such as "Are you over 19 years of age?" or "Are you authorized to submit this request?".
- [Issuer](issuer.md): when credentials with a custom set of attributes are required and existing credentials issued by another authority  cannot be reused.

For more information about these digital experiences, please explore the [Digital Trust Toolkit](https://bcgov.github.io/digital-trust-toolkit/).
