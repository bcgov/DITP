## Access Overview

The Access experience pattern leverages digital credentials to simplify and secure the way users access services online or in-person. By utilizing digital credentials stored in a digital wallet, users can seamlessly prove their identity or attributes without relying on traditional usernames and passwords or physical IDs. This approach enhances user convenience and strengthens security across various digital interactions.

**How it works**
Digital Trust Access enables users to securely and seamlessly access services online or in person using verifiable digital credentials. The process involves three key steps: Request, Verify, Access.

**Request:** The user initiates the process by navigating to the service website and scanning a QR code using their BC Wallet.

**Verify:** The service requests proof of identity or credentials, which the user reviews and shares through their BC Wallet.

**Access:** The service validates the credentials via the verifiable data registry and grants the user access to the digital service.

Technology Required:

- **BC Wallet:** A secure digital wallet application for storing and managing digital credentials.
- **Digital credential(s):** A cryptographically secure and verifiable proof of identity or attributes.
- **Your digital service:** The service being accessed, which relies on digital credentials for authentication.

### Benefits
**Problem:** Traditional access methods, such as usernames and passwords, present significant security vulnerabilities and are often cumbersome for people. These methods are prone to data breaches, phishing attacks, and require extensive management for password recovery and updates.

**Benefits:** Digital credentials address these issues by providing a more secure and user-friendly authentication method. They offer cryptographic assurance, reducing the risk of data breaches and identity theft. Additionally, digital credentials streamline the access process, improving the overall user experience and aligning with best practices in digital identity management.

### Suitable use cases
The BC Government offers a variety of solutions for accessing services online or in person, with digital trust and credentials emerging as innovative methods to enhance and complement existing systems. Digital trust solutions provide flexible and secure access, making them suitable for a range of applications.

**Consider Digital Trust If:**

- **New or Existing Services:** Digital trust is valuable for both new and existing services, providing secure access and extending into other experiences like signing, issuing, and messaging through BC Wallet app.
- **Leveraging Existing Credentials:** There are existing digital credentials that can be integrated into your service. If your service requires the issuance of a new credential, that is also possible (see the Issue experience pattern.)
- **Team and Buy-in:** Your organization has the appropriate team and buy-in to lead the adoption of digital trust, ideally agile teams with an appetite for experimentation and innovation.

### Examples
Below are examples illustrating the Access pattern through a sequence diagram and a real-world case study.

**Traction Sequence Diagram Example**

The following sequence diagram visualizes the Access pattern using digital credentials using Traction. It demonstrates the process of a person (Holder) accessing a service (Verifier) with a digital credential issued in their BC wallet.
