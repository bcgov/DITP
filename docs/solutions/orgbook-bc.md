# OrgBook BC

[OrgBook BC](https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca) is a public repository of credentials representing public information. The foundational credential for OrgBook is a company registration credential issued by [BC Registries](https://www.bcregistry.gov.bc.ca). Credentials are also issued for relevant events such as name changes, amalgamations, etc.

Third party issuers can issue credentials such as licenses and permits to OrgBook and bind them to the relevant receiving entity for public discovery and consumption.

## Accessing OrgBook Data

There are two ways of accessing data stored in OrgBook:

- The user interface allows the search and discovery of credentials from a web UI. This is useful for end-users trying to gather information about a known entity.
- The [OrgBook API](https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/api/)

The API is openly accessible (for reasonably/fair use) and allows systems to integrate with OrgBook to look-up company registration records and associated data.

The swagger interface provides an easy way to discover the API endpoints, and there are [API docs](https://bcgov.github.io/orgbook-bc-api-docs) with code snippets providing examples for common use cases.

## Becoming an Issuer

If you have a good candidate for a credential to be publicly issued to an organization (such as a license or permit), you can become an issuer and integrate and push the information to OrgBook.

These are some of the [other permit/license credentials issued by different organizations to OrgBook](https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/about/orgbook-data).

The current version of OrgBook is in evolution, the best way to get the conversation started is by [contacting us](../about-us.md).
