## Activity guide
Use the sequence diagram template to map out interactions for your use case. Identify key actors and detail the step-by-step flow of actions. Include any unique interactions specific to your scenario.

### Whatâ€™s it for:
Visualizing interactions between entities to ensure all steps in credential management are clear and accounted for.

### What youâ€™ll get:
A detailed sequence diagram outlining the interactions and processes involved, helping guide technical implementation.

### When to do it:
During the discovery phase, once you've identified your use case and technology stack.

## How it works

### Before you start this activity
<!-- -   Identify a use case - to help identify one, have an [ideation workshop **INTERNAL LINK**](...) -->
-   Decide on the technology stack

1.  **Review the template:** 
Explore the Miro board layout to guide your sequence diagram creation.

2.  **Adjust to meet your needs:** 
Modify the template to reflect complex, iterative or concurrent interactions as needed.

3.  **Facilitate workshop:** 
Use the board as a guide to achieve the workshop objectives.
    
### Next steps:
-   Share the diagram with your team for alignment
<!-- -   Complete the [Discovery checklist **INTERNAL LINK**](...) to proceed to the Trial phase -->
