## Activity guide
Having a support model and support plan in place when building technological solutions is crucial for multiple reasons:

*   **Issue resolution**: Technical issues and bugs are identified and resolved quickly, minimizing downtime.
    
*   **User satisfaction**: Reliable support helps maintain user satisfaction, which is crucial when trying to generate buy-in in the pilot stage.
    
*   **UX refinement**: Support requests can help identify pain points and provide insights on improvements toward the user experience.
    
*   **Cost management**: Being able to detect and prevent small issues from escalating to larger problems saves cost.
    
*   **Scalability**: A well-structured support plan can scale with a growing number of users and ensure consistent service quality.

This workshop template enables you to collaboratively identify support needs and develop a corresponding support model and plan for your use case.

### Whatâ€™s it for:
Building a support framework that meets the needs of users.

### What youâ€™ll get:
An overview of support needs for the use case, a visualization of your support model and a support plan draft.

### When to do it:
In the Trial phase, before the pilot is launched. 

## How it works

### Before you start this activity
-   Identify relevant meeting participants
-   Schedule a session

1.  **Review the template:** 
Explore the Miro board's structure and layout. Does the structure of the sections align with your needs.

2.  **Adjust to meet your needs:** 
Adjust the workshop agenda and activities as needed to get the most out of the workshop.

3.  **Facilitate workshop:** 
Use the board as a guide to achieve the workshop objectives.
    
### Next steps:
-   Review and refine your support model visualization and support model plan with your organization and collaborators
